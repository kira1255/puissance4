firebase aussi, elle est dispo en ligne ici: https://puissance-4-documentation.web.app\ni18n\nL'appli est traduite en anglais et en espagnol, j'ai hebergé les 3 versions sur 3 urls pour ne pas m'embêter avec les règles de réécriture sur firebase. On peut naviger entre les versions depuis la homepage, sinon les urls sont là:\nFR : https://puissance-4-6585f.web.app\nEN : https://puissance-4-en.web.app\nES : https://puissance-4-es.web.app\nPWA\nL'appli est installable, sur android la popup doit s'afficher automatiquement pour installer le jeu, sur IOS il faut aller dans le menu et sélectionner \"Ajouter à l'écran d'accueil\" depuis safari.\nChanger de langue sur la PWA ouvrir un navigateur simplifié car chaque langue a son domaine.\nNGXS\nJ'ai utilisé deux stores :\nUn tout simple pour le dark theme : https://puissance-4-documentation.web.app/classes/ThemeStateModel.html#source\nUn plus fourni pour gérer le jeu : https://puissance-4-documentation.web.app/classes/GameStateModel.html#source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
